# face-recognition-based-attendance-system-master
This project creates a face recognition attendance system for schools, replacing less efficient methods. The system (A2MS) automatically records daily attendance using facial recognition. It generates reports and notifies relevant parties if a student's monthly attendance drops below 60%.
